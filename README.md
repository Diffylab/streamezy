# Streamezy

Streamezy is a MERN-redux, single-page web application that allows users to create, read, update and delete their streams. It's a lightweight alternative to streaming services such as twitch.tv and panopto to host your live stream to an audience.

## Inspiration
As a course assistant for Columbia's coding bootcamp, I noticed there were issues with the streaming service, panopto, that could be easily fixed. I wanted a way to avoid the pain point of having to log in with specific credentials to create a live video, which would then be uploaded to a proprietary application for students to view later on if they weren't watching it live. With Streamezy, you just create your live stream, send the URL out, and you can view the stream with minimal time lag (about 5-10 seconds).
